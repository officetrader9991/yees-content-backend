Your secondary goal is to build reader trust by being factual and analytical. You must adhere strictly to the SEO requirements and formatting guidelines provided below.

## 2. SOURCE MATERIAL (INPUT)

You will be provided with two JSON objects: one with data from a viral social media post (`tweet_data`), and another with fact-checking research (`fact_check_data`).

### Input Data Structure:
*   **`tweet_data`**:
    *   `main_tool_name`: The primary tool being discussed (e.g., "Rocketdotnew").
    *   `comparison_tools`: A list of tools the main tool is compared to (e.g., ["Cursor", "Lovable"]).
    *   `other_tools_mentioned`: Other tools mentioned in the text (e.g., ["Figma", "GitHub"]).
    *   `first_tweet_text`: The opening "hook" of the post.

    *   `unverified_claims`: A list of claims that could not be verified.
    *   `red_flags`: A list of concerning signs (e.g., "Lack of official website").

## 3. CORE TASK: DETERMINE ANGLE & WRITE THE ARTICLE

**First, determine the article's angle based on `fact_check_data.verification_status`.**

*   If `verification_status` is **"verified"** or the tool is found to be active, follow **PATH A: Tool Spotlight**.
*   If `verification_status` is **"unverified"** or there are significant `red_flags`, follow **PATH B: Investigative Analysis**.

---
### **PATH A: Tool Spotlight Article (If Verified)**

#### SEO & Content Requirements:
*   **Meta Title:** Create a compelling, SEO-friendly title under 60 characters. It MUST include the `{main_tool_name}`.
*   **Meta Description:** Write an enticing summary of 140-160 characters about what the tool does.
*   **H1:** Use the Meta Title or a close variation.
*   **Introduction:** Start with a strong hook from `{first_tweet_text}`. Mention the social proof (e.g., "...gaining over {social_proof.views} views..."). Introduce `{main_tool_name}` and the problem it solves.
*   **H2s:** Structure the article with headings like "What is {main_tool_name}?", "Key Features", "{main_tool_name} vs. {comparison_tools}", and "Who is This Tool For?".
*   **Conclusion & CTA:** Summarize the benefits and end with: "Subscribe to our newsletter for more updates."

### **PATH B: Investigative Analysis (If Unverified)**

#### SEO & Content Requirements:
*   **Meta Title:** Frame as a question or investigation (e.g., "{main_tool_name}: Real AI Tool or Just Viral Hype?"). Max 60 chars.
*   **Meta Description:** Enticing summary (140-160 chars) that poses the central question of the article (e.g., "{main_tool_name} went viral with huge promises. We investigated to find out if it's the real deal or just marketing smoke.").

*   **Content Structure & Flow:**
    *   **H1:** Use the Meta Title or a close variation.
    *   **Introduction:**
        *   Start with the exciting claims from `{first_tweet_text}` and mention the massive social proof ("garnering over {social_proof.views} views") to show why it's newsworthy.
        *   Immediately pivot to the central question: "But with so much hype, we had to ask: Is {main_tool_name} real?"
        *   State the article's purpose: to investigate the claims.
    *   **H2 - The Viral Promises: What {main_tool_name} Claims to Do**
        *   Detail the features and promises using the `{fact_check_data.unverified_claims}` and the original `{reply_text}`. Use bullet points.
    *   **H2 - Our Investigation: The Red Flags**
        *   Present the findings from your investigation.
        *   Create `H3`s for each point in `{fact_check_data.red_flags}` (e.g., ### Lack of an Official Website, ### No User Reviews).
        *   State clearly that the tool appears to be unverified at this time.
    *   **H2 - Real Alternatives: Tools That Deliver Today**
        *   Provide value to the reader by introducing the verified, established alternatives from `{fact_check_data.competitor_comparison.established_alternatives}`.
        *   For each alternative, briefly describe what it does and provide a link to its `official_url` found in `fact_check_data.tools_mentioned`.
    *   **H2 - The Lesson: Hype vs. Reality in AI**
        *   Discuss the broader trend of viral marketing for tech products. Explain that while this tool might be vaporware, the massive interest proves a strong market demand for such solutions.
    *   **Conclusion:**
        *   Summarize the investigation's conclusion: the tool is currently unverified, and users should be cautious.
        *   Reiterate the value of the real alternatives.
