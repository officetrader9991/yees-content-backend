✅ SEO Blog Post Requirements (to Rank High)
1. 🧠 Keyword Relevance & Intent
Target keywords must be naturally used throughout the post (not keyword stuffing).
**Keyword Placement**: Integrate the primary keyword within the first 100-150 words, in at least one `H2` heading, and in the final paragraph.

Match search intent (informational, transactional, navigational).

Use tools like Google Trends, Ahrefs, or SEMrush (or fetch keywords from Perplexity) to identify related keywords and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) terms.

2. 🧱 Content Structure
Use proper heading hierarchy:

H1: Main title (only one)

H2: Section headings

H3: Sub-points under sections

**Featured Snippet Optimization**: Structure content to answer specific questions directly. Use headings like "What is..." or "How to..." to capture snippet opportunities.

Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences max)

Use bullet points, bold text, and numbered lists for clarity

3. ✍️ Meta Elements
Title: Under 60 characters; includes primary keyword

Meta description: 140–160 characters; enticing, with keyword

URL slug: Simple, readable, keyword-focused

4. 📖 Content Quality & Length
At least 800–1200 words for basic ranking; longer is better for competitive topics (1500–2500)

Unique, non-AI-sounding (though it's AI-written, should feel human)

**E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)**: Content must be credible.
- Attribute content to a real author with a bio.
- Back up claims with links to reputable sources or data.
- Demonstrate first-hand experience where possible.

Backed by facts, examples, external links if necessary

Use actual use cases or step-by-step breakdowns when possible

5. 🔁 Internal & External Links
Link to relevant internal pages (e.g. product, about, category)

Include 1–2 high-quality outbound links (e.g. GitHub repo, Figma, Wikipedia)

6. 🎯 Call to Action (CTA)
End the post with a clear action (e.g. "Try Rocket today", "Follow for more tools", "Leave a comment")

7. 📱 Readability
Write at Grade 7–9 reading level

Avoid jargon unless the target audience is expert-level

Use active voice and engaging tone

8. 📷 Media (Optional but Helpful)
Include images or diagrams (can be added later)

Add alt text for all media for accessibility + SEO

**Descriptive Filenames**: Use keyword-rich filenames for images (e.g., `seo-best-practices.jpg` instead of `IMG_1234.jpg`).

✅ Optional (but Good for SEO)
Include a FAQ section using common queries (for Google rich snippets)

Use schema.org structured data (later on your CMS)

**Advanced SEO Strategies**

- **Topic Clusters**: Build authority by creating a main "pillar" article that links out to several related, in-depth "cluster" articles. Those cluster articles should link back to the pillar.
- **Content Freshness**: Periodically review and update existing posts with new information, stats, and links to keep them relevant.
- **User Experience (Writer's Contribution)**: While technical, writers can help by:
  - Keeping content scannable and mobile-friendly.
  - Using compressed images to avoid slowing down page load time.
  - Limiting intrusive elements that disrupt the reader.
